#### All the stuff needed if I break the site again


Last update on **_August 7th 2019_**

### TODO:

- [x] Make a github repo for the site
- [ ] Learn some CSS and try to make a **working** menu in HTML \(current)
- [ ] Create a embedded _contact_ form

## How do things look like right now _(not great)_

I've never been much into HTML nor CSS, and this experiment is perfect for some self-education. I've got some minor experience with WordPress powered blogs, but they were always quickly abandoned.
I hope I do better this time.
